# Quick Start Guide üöÄ

Get up and running with Audio Assistant in 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Navigate to **API Keys** (in left sidebar)
4. Click **"Create new secret key"**
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
6. Keep it safe! You'll need it in Step 3

**Note**: Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account. Check at https://platform.openai.com/usage

## Step 2: Build the Application

```bash
cd rust-course/audio-assistant
cargo build --release
```

This will take a few minutes the first time.

## Step 3: Run and Configure

```bash
cargo run --release
```

When the app opens:

1. Click on **"‚öôÔ∏è Configuration"** to expand it
2. Paste your OpenAI API key in the **"OpenAI API Key"** field
3. Click **"üíæ Save Configuration"**
4. You should see "Configuration saved" in the status

## Step 4: Set Up System Audio Capture (Linux)

To capture system audio instead of just your microphone:

### Quick Setup (PulseAudio)

```bash
# Load loopback module
pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1

# Install and run audio mixer
sudo apt install pavucontrol  # Ubuntu/Debian
pavucontrol
```

In `pavucontrol`:
- Go to the **"Recording"** tab
- Find **"ALSA plug-in [audio-assistant]"** 
- Change from "Built-in Audio" to **"Monitor of [your output device]"**

### Quick Setup (PipeWire)

```bash
# Install control panel
sudo apt install pavucontrol  # Works with PipeWire too!
pavucontrol
```

Same steps as above - PipeWire is compatible with PulseAudio tools.

## Step 5: Start Listening!

1. Click the **"üé§ Start Listening"** button (turns red)
2. Play some audio (YouTube video, podcast, meeting call, etc.)
3. Watch the **Transcriptions** section fill up automatically
4. Wait for summaries to appear in the **Latest Summary** section

## Step 6: Stop and Review

1. Click **"‚èπ Stop Listening"** when done
2. Review your transcriptions and summaries
3. Check out any action items that were identified

## Files Location

All your data is saved in:
```
~/.local/share/audio-assistant/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio_chunks/        # Audio files (if kept)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transcriptions/      # JSON files with transcribed text
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ summaries/          # JSON files with summaries and action items
```

## Test It Out

**Simple Test**:
1. Start Listening
2. Play this YouTube video: "Ted Talk" (any short one)
3. Wait 30-60 seconds
4. Check the Transcriptions section
5. Look for the auto-generated summary

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "No default input device found"
```bash
# Check if PulseAudio is running
systemctl --user status pulseaudio

# Restart if needed
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio
```

### "OpenAI API key is not set"
- Make sure you clicked "Save Configuration" after entering your key
- Check: `cat ~/.config/audio-assistant/config.json`

### Not capturing system audio (only microphone)
- You need to set up audio loopback (see Step 4)
- Use `pavucontrol` to route audio properly

### "Transcription failed" errors
- Check you have OpenAI credits: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check your internet connection

## Usage Tips

### For Meetings
- **Chunk Duration**: 30-60 seconds works best
- **Real-time Processing**: Enable for live notes
- Start listening before the meeting begins

### For Podcasts/Videos
- **Chunk Duration**: 60 seconds for better context
- **Real-time Processing**: Can disable and summarize at the end
- Quality depends on audio clarity

### To Save Money
- Increase chunk duration (fewer API calls)
- Disable real-time processing
- Only run during important content

## Cost Estimation

**For a 1-hour meeting**:
- Transcription: ~$0.36
- Summarization: ~$0.10-0.20
- **Total**: ~$0.50/hour

Much cheaper than manual transcription services!

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable:
- Adjust chunk duration in Configuration
- Try batch mode (disable real-time processing)
- Explore the JSON files in `~/.local/share/audio-assistant/`
- Modify the code to suit your needs!
